AWS Directory Service Test Harness
==================================

A Terraform plan to set up an AWS Directory Service "Simple AD"
and join a Windows box to the domain for administration. Good for
showing engineers how AD works.

This isn't totally working yet; having some problems getting Amazon
SSM document to associate to the instance.
